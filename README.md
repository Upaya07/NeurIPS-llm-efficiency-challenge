# NeurIPS-llm-efficiency-challenge

[Our model](https://huggingface.co/upaya07/model_02) won 🏆 first prize 🏆 in RTX 4090 track in [NeurIPS Large Language Model Efficiency Challenge: 1 LLM + 1GPU + 1Day](https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/) competition. We used [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) as a base model and used QLoRA to fine-tune it for 24 hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU.
