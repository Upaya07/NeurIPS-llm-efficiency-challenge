[Our model](https://huggingface.co/upaya07/model_02) won üèÜ first prize üèÜ in RTX 4090 track in [NeurIPS Large Language Model Efficiency Challenge: 1 LLM + 1GPU + 1Day](https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/) competition. We used [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) as a base model and used QLoRA to fine-tune it for 24 hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

### Natural Instructions Dataset Preparation
[Natural Instructions](https://github.com/allenai/natural-instructions) dataset is a community effort to create a large collection of tasks and their natural language definitions/instructions. As show in above diagram, we sample from Natural Instructions dataset. Here is the 4-step process:
- Out of 1600+ tasks files, we first manually select ~450 task files relevant to the competition. **We do not use any MMLU or translation tasks.**
- A task output in Natural Instructions dataset is expected to be either an exact match or an open ended generation. Hence, we manually annotate each task file as one of two categories: Exact Match or Generation.
- We run few-shot inference on selected task files. Running few-shot inference helps with controlled generation so we can compute model performance metric quantitatively. Refer to Input and Output Schema for Mistral Inference for an example.
  - For Exact Match, we use accuracy as metric.
  - For Generation task, we use Rouge score as performance metric.
- Sampling logic: We sample ~50k examples from Generation tasks and ~50k examples from Exact Match tasks. This makes it total ~100k instances from Natural Instructions dataset.
  - For Exact match tasks: % of examples sampled from a task file depend on accuracy of that task. In general, we sample more from low-accuracy tasks and less from high-accuracy tasks. Total ~50k examples are sampled from exact match task files.
  - For Generation tasks: % of examples sampled from a task file depend on Rouge score on that task. In general, we sample more from tasks with low rouge scores. Total ~50k examples are sampled from generation task files.

#### Input and Output Schema for Mistral Inference
A record from a task file from Natural Instruction data is converted into below format. `orig_input` field is actual input without few-shot examples. `few_shot_prompt` field represents a few-shot example and is passed to Mistral-7B model for prediction. `answer` is ground truth and `prediction` is output generated by Mistral-7B base model.
```
{
  "orig_input": "Context: I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police. #Adapt @chrisrock\u2014 Isaiah Washington (@IWashington) April 1, 2015 Question: how many prius's did they buy? Answer: three",
  "few_shot_prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.
